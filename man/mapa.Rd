\title{Multiple Aggregation Prediction Algorithm (Wrapper)}

\description{Wrapper to estimate and produce MAPA in- and out-of-sample forecasts. 
Uses mapaest and mapafor.}

\usage{
mapa(y, ppy, fh = ppy, ifh = 1, minimumAL = 1, maximumAL = ppy, 
	   comb = "mean", paral = 0, display = 0, outplot = 1, hybrid = TRUE, 
     model = "ZZZ", conf.lvl = NULL)
}

\arguments{
  \item{y}{
    In sample observations of a time series (vector). If y == "paper" then it prints paper reference.
}
  \item{ppy}{
    Periods in a season of the time series at the sampled frequency.
    If insample is a ts object then this is taken from its frequency, unless overriden.
}
  \item{fh}{
    Forecast horizon. Default = ppy.
}
  \item{ifh}{
    Lower aggregation level to use. Default = 1.
}
  \item{minimumAL}{
    Lowest aggregation level to use. Default = 1.
}
  \item{maximumAL}{
    Highest aggregation level to use. Default = ppy, maximumAL>1.
}
  \item{comb}{
    Combination operator. One of "mean" or "median". Default is "mean".
}
  \item{paral}{
    Use parallel processing. 0 = no; 1 = yes (requires initialised cluster); 2 = yes and initialise cluster. Default is 0.
}
  \item{display}{
    Display calculation progress in console. 0 = no; 1 = yes. Default is 0.
}
  \item{outplot}{
    Provide output plot. 0 = no; 1 = yes. Default is 1.
}
  \item{hybrid}{
    Provide hybrid forecasts, as in Kourentzes et al. paper. If minimumAL > 1 then the minimumAL ETS forecasts are used. Default is TRUE.
}
  \item{model}{
    Allow only that type of ETS at each aggregation level. This follows similar coding to the ets function. The first letter refers to the error type ("A", "M" or "Z"); the second letter refers to the trend type ("N","A","Ad","M","Md" or "Z"); and the third letter refers to the season type ("N","A","M" or "Z"). The letters mean: "N"=none, "A"=additive, "M"=multiplicative and "Z"=automatically selected. A "d" for trend implies damped. By default model="ZZZ". If due to sample limitation ETS cannot be calculated at an aggregation level for the selected model, then no estimation is done for that specific level. 
}
  \item{conf.lvl}{
    Vector of confidence level for prediction intervals. Values must be (0,1). If conf.lvl == NULL then no intervals are calculated. For example to get the intervals for 80\% and 95\% use conf.lvl=c(0.8,0.95).
}
}
\value{
\item{infor}{In-sample forecasts.}
\item{outfor}{Out-of-sample forecasts.}
\item{PI}{Prediction intervals for given confidence levels.}
\item{MSE}{In-sample MSE error.}
\item{MAE}{In-sample MAE error.}
}
\note{The calculation of the prediction intervals is based on the empirical multiple step ahead MSE. To speed up calculations set conf.lvl=NULL. If very long forecast horizons are requested then once no more t+h MSE can be calculated the following approximation is used: sqrt(MSE_{t+1})*sqrt(h) for the error.}
