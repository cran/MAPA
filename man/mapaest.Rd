\title{MAPA Estimation}
\description{
The following function estimates MAPA and saves all fitted model.
}
\usage{
mapaest(y, ppy, minimumAL = 1, maximumAL = ppy, paral = 0, 
	      display = 0, outplot = 1, model = "ZZZ")
}
\arguments{
  \item{y}{
    In sample observations of a time series (vector).
}
  \item{ppy}{
    Periods in a season of the time series at the sampled frequency.
    If insample is a ts object then this is taken from its frequency, unless overriden.
}
  \item{minimumAL}{
    Lowest aggregation level to use. Default = 1, maximumAL>1.
}
  \item{maximumAL}{
    Highest aggregation level to use. Default = ppy.
}
  \item{paral}{
    Use parallel processing. 0 = no; 1 = yes (requires initialised cluster); 2 = yes 
	and initialise cluster. Default is 0.
}
  \item{display}{
    Display calculation progress in console. 0 = no; 1 = yes. Default is 0.
}
  \item{outplot}{
    Provide output plot. 0 = no; 1 = yes. Default is 1.
}
  \item{model}{
    Allow only that type of ETS at each aggregation level. This follows similar coding to the ets function. The first letter refers to the error type ("A", "M" or "Z"); the second letter refers to the trend type ("N","A","Ad","M","Md" or "Z"); and the third letter refers to the season type ("N","A","M" or "Z"). The letters mean: "N"=none, "A"=additive, "M"=multiplicative and "Z"=automatically selected. A "d" for trend implies damped. By default model="ZZZ". If due to sample limitation ETS cannot be calculated at an aggregation level for the selected model, then no estimation is done for that specific level. For aggregation levels that seasonality becomes 1 then a non-seasonal model is estimated.
